# MEGASAT_MplotR_mod
Modified version of MEGASAT (beiko-lab/MEGASAT)'s Mplot.R script

A modified version of the Mplot.R script from beiko-lab/MEGASAT tool.<br><br>
This modified version produces histograms with bins for all (potential) alleles found for a marker.
The original version only displays bins for which there were fragment length counts in that particular sample.
<br><br>
Modified version is run as the same way as the original.
